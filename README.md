## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-coding-extension.git
cd my-coding-extension
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Your API Key
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create `.env` in the project root):
  ```
  GROQ_API_KEY=sk-...
  ```
- **Never commit your `.env` file!** (It is in `.gitignore` by default.)

### 4. Start the Local Embedding Server
- Go to `local-embeddings-server/` and start the FastAPI server:
  ```sh
  cd local-embeddings-server
  venv\Scripts\activate  # (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS)
  python server.py
  ```
- The server should run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 5. Run/Debug the Extension
- Open the project in VS Code.
- Press `F5` to launch the extension in a new Extension Development Host window.

## Usage
- Open the AI Copilot chat from the sidebar.
- Upload files or paste code snippets for RAG.
- Ask questions about your code, docs, or any uploaded content.
- For normal coding questions, just chat‚Äîno file upload needed!

---

## Security & Privacy
- Your `.env` file is **never** committed to git.
- All embeddings for RAG are generated locally‚Äîno code or docs are sent to the cloud.
- Only your questions are sent to Groq for LLM answers.
